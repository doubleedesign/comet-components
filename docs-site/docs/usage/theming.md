# Theming 

## Setting colours, fonts, etc

### In WordPress
- Set colours and gradients in your theme's `theme.json` file. WordPress will automatically pick up on these for use in the editor, and the Comet Canvas theme will inject them as CSS variables in the relevant places (overriding the Comet default ones).
- Set fonts with the `--font-family-body` and `--font-family-accent` CSS variables in your theme's `style.css`.
- Override any of the other default Comet CSS variables (e.g., spacing, container sizes) in your theme's `style.css`.

### In other projects
- Set colours and fonts by overriding CSS vairables in your own `style.css` file.
