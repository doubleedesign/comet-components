# Introduction

Comet Components is a web UI component library initially being developed for PHP as an abstraction layer for WordPress
blocks, with the intention of being able to use the same components in other projects.

It is built with an object-oriented architecture, where each component is passed an array of `$attributes` and in most
cases, either a string of `$content` or an array of component objects called `$innerComponents`. In a small number of
cases, a different structure is passed to construct the instance within itself, such as the `Table` block receiving an
array of `$data`.
