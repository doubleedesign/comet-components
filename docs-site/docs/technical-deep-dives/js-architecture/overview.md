# JavaScript Overview

While Comet Components is primarily a PHP framework, JavaScript is utilised to provide client-side enhancements where appropriate.

For simple enhancements, plain JavaScript should be used, in a file co-located with the component it applies to. See the [JavaScript](./javascript.md) page for detailed instructions on how to integrate JavaScript when creating or improving components.

For more advanced enhancements, Comet Components supports [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) through [Vue SFC Loader](https://github.com/FranckFreiburger/vue3-sfc-loader). See the [Vue.js](./vue.md) page for detailed instructions on how to create Vue-enhanced Comet components.
