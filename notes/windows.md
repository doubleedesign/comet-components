# Appendix: From-scratch environment setup on Windows

As a first step, if you prefer the command line I'd recommend installing [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/)
if you haven't already. If you prefer to do things using a GUI, you might like to
use [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/windows). If you don't have existing instances of PHP, Composer, or Node
installed, the latter basically gets you up and running out-of-the-box.

The below-linked notes detail how I set up my local development environment, along with some other options I have
tested. It is not essential to follow these steps or to use the same setup as me, but they may be helpful if you are new
to any of the tools or technologies listed here or are new to using Windows for web development.

These notes cover both doing everything natively (using PowerShell as your terminal) and using WSL (for a Bash
terminal), and also include IDE configuration information for PHPStorm.
