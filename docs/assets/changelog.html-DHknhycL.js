While it was (and is) still very much an active business, it had taken a backseat to the full-time job at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlassian</a> and on top of the time constraints of juggling both, I didn&#39;t feel like I&#39;d earned the right to public self-congratulations for it.</p><p>The following month, I had the pleasure of presenting a talk on reusable components at <a href="https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordCamp Sydney</a>, where I got many ideas both from feedback on my talk and from some of the other talks. This was also where, by complete chance and with incredibly serendipitous timing, I reconnected with <a href="https://www.muzkore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murray Chapman</a>, one of my favourite teachers from my long educational journey; the one I credit with teaching me to code - you guessed it - 15 years prior.</p><p>So while I solemnly swear I am not a Swiftie, when I was trying to come up with a name related to the number 15, I was also reminded of fellow WordCamp speaker <a href="https://www.sandzstudio.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Lopez</a> saying her advice to people new to the industry is to &quot;be a little fearless&quot; which I vibed with so much that this release pretty much couldn&#39;t be named anything else!

While we didn&#39;t get a chance to dig into the specifics of<br><em>how</em> he does this, I was fascinated by the idea and quickly investigated it further when I next had a project that could benefit from it.

We did a little &quot;introduce yourself and what you got your scholarship for&quot; exercise and when I said I got mine for multimedia, Sarah&#39;s eyes lit up and so began an unofficial mentorship that very much shaped my early career.</p><p>Sarah was one of the people who encouraged me to start <a href="https://www.doubleedesign.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my business</a>, referred me for my first teaching job (delivering 1-2 day short courses on Adobe software and WordPress), and encouraged me to get my Cert IV so I could side-hustle teach at TAFE (and I totally name-dropped her in an interview 5 years later). Importantly, she was proof that these things were achievable because she was doing them herself. Possibly my first exposure to a &quot;portfolio career&quot; person, her influence and guidance were instrumental in shaping my early career.</p><p>This release will be named when I work out something suitable from one of Sarah&#39;s favourite artists, or I think of something that honours Licorice Frog, the name of her design business at the time.</p></details><hr><h2 id="release-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#release-history"><span>Release History</span></a></h2><p>None.</p>',19)]))}const d=a(r,[["render",s]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/about/changelog.html","title":"Releases","lang":"en-AU","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Current version","slug":"current-version","link":"#current-version","children":[{"level":3,"title":"0.0.1 Fearless (6 April 2025)","slug":"_0-0-1-fearless-6-april-2025","link":"#_0-0-1-fearless-6-april-2025","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Roadmap","slug":"roadmap","link":"#roadmap","children":[{"level":3,"title":"0.0.2 London Calling","slug":"_0-0-2-london-calling","link":"#_0-0-2-london-calling","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"1.0.0 TBC","slug":"_1-0-0-tbc","link":"#_1-0-0-tbc","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Release History","slug":"release-history","link":"#release-history","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1744159358000,"contributors":[{"name":"Leesa Ward","username":"","email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","commits":7}],"changelog":[{"hash":"0eb9418c193f20d333e9ff5930d3f334a647f41e","time":1744159358000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Add version to Core composer.json; add release notes; update docs build"},{"hash":"bd46ea421c43d7241b0682e551b9810fce24a5c8","time":1742709938000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Docs: Finish migrating docs to VuePress"},{"hash":"593c083e86d6a8baa7e78e6af98e148d7f5d69b9","time":1742624410000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"More work on new docs; WIP on updating and improving doc generation for abstract classes/traits/types"},{"hash":"303cb71ac1533272d792db6690210a5dbf5cf23c","time":1742550096000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Docs: Start basic VuePress site for Markdown docs"},{"hash":"c6665c91563bd746d79ac7bd4c63c6b4459c380b","time":1742471793000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Test(Core): Work on examples/stories"},{"hash":"062d086c180cdcd246cdf6d8ae9a147b1bcd92e1","time":1739748225000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Remove some components to be implemented later; Docs: Add intended release and roadmap info"},{"hash":"73b48153193a045811bda794254cd57c2899142f","time":1739748225000,"email":"leesa@doubleedesign.com.au","author":"Leesa Ward","message":"Remove some components to be implemented later; Docs: Add intended release and roadmap info"}]},"filePathRelative":"about/changelog.md"}');export{d as comp,h as data};
