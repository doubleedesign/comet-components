# Comet Components


---

## Usage
### In WordPress

#### Installation
// TODO

#### Theme setup
For best results, use the plugin along with the Comet Canvas theme as a parent theme, and your project's theme as a child theme.

#### Setting colours, fonts, etc
- Set colours and gradients in your theme's `theme.json` file. WordPress will automatically pick up on these for use in the editor, and the Comet Canvas theme will inject them as CSS variables in the relevant places (overriding the Comet default ones).
- Set fonts with the `--font-family-body` and `--font-family-accent` CSS variables in your theme's `style.css`.
- Override any of the other default Comet CSS variables (e.g., spacing, container sizes) in your theme's `style.css`.

#### Overriding Blade templates
You can override the rendering template for a component by creating a Blade file with the same name in your theme's `components` directory.

### As a standalone PHP library
// TODO

### In a standalone HTML project
You could use Comet Components without PHP by including the compiled CSS files and relevant JS in your project, and replicating the HTML that the PHP component classes generate.
