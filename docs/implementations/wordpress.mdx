# WordPress usage

## Comet Components plugin and Comet Canvas theme

The Comet Components plugin provides:
- implementations of core blocks listed in its `block-support.json` file
- additional blocks and variations that correspond to Comet components such as `Container`, `Call-to-Action`, `Callout`, `FileGroup`, `Accordion`, and `Tabs`
- support for using Comet Components for reusable blocks (synced patterns), such as a call-to-action used in multiple places on a site
- The [Block Supports Extended plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/block-supports-extended) as an "embedded plugin"[^2] to provide some custom block attributes in a native-looking way.

Comet Components blocks utilise core blocks and options where practical, but some blocks do use ACF Pro where it provides a better user experience. You can use Comet without ACF, you'll just be missing some blocks.

The Comet Canvas theme is designed to be used as a parent theme and provides:
- Common navigation menu configuration
- Implementations of Comet's `SiteHeader`, `PageHeader`, and `SiteFooter` components (with relevant inner components like `Menu` and `Breadcrumbs`) in the relevant files as per the WordPress template hierarchy
- Injection of theme colours from `theme.json` as embedded CSS variables in the `<head>`
- Enqueueing of theme `style.css` files in the block editor and front-end
- Site Health checks for required and recommended plugins.

### Installation

### Extension and support plugins

- I always use Comet along with my [Base plugin](https://github.com/doubleedesign/doublee-base-plugin) which provides some admin customisations, site "Global Options", and other features and customisations I commonly need for client sites. It shouldn't be essential but some blocks and template parts will be missing things without it.
- Some Comet and Base Plugin blocks and features require the [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) plugin. If you don't have this installed, some blocks and options will be missing.
- To enable breadcrumbs in the `PageHeader` component, install and activate my [Breadcrumbs plugin](https://github.com/doubleedesign/doublee-breadcrumbs).
- For managing and displaying events, I have created an [Events plugin](https://github.com/doubleedesign/doublee-events-plugin) that integrates with Comet Components (this is not in the core Comet plugin because it uses custom post types and taxonomies, which not all sites need).
- Some block attributes require the [Block Supports Extended plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/block-supports-extended). This is a Composer dependency of Comet Components so does not need to be installed separately.

## Using Comet Components with ACF blocks

When creating a new block for a client site, I usually:
- use [ACF Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/) to meet the particular requirements of that client[^1]
- set at least one parent block - usually a layout or content grouping component such as `Container`, `Column`, `Group`, or `PanelContent`
- set the `renderTemplate` in `block.json` and convert the ACF field data to Comet component instances rendered in that file
- prefix the block name with a client-specific name, e.g., `karilee/classes`
- use API version 2 in `block.json`, because version 3 is known to cause some problems with preview mode.

These blocks to be accounted for in the `render_block` and `process_innerblocks` methods in the Comet plugin's `BlockRenderer` class, ensuring that the `PreprocessedHTML` component is used to render them.
Otherwise, they will either render nothing at all, or will throw a `RuntimeException` because there is no matching component.
In most cases, this is already taken care of by those methods checking for prefixes other than `core/` and `comet/`. I just wanted to note it here because it caused some seriously head-scratching silent failures early on and is likely to again if there are situations I have not accounted for yet.

[^1]: If the block is generic enough that it can be created with simple core/Comet block combinations, there's a good chance it can go in the Comet plugin for use by all clients.
[^2]: An "embedded plugin" is an unofficial term, a somewhat experimental thing I have implemented to include small essential plugins within my own by having them as a Composer dependency.

## Some notes about custom WordPress blocks

### Saving with minimal markup

When creating blocks without ACF i.e., with core `edit` and `save` functions, there are some key things to know:
1. The `edit` function determines what is shown in the editor, so you should try to mimic the Comet Components output as closely as possible for ease of styling and consistency between the front and back-ends.
2. There are two approaches to the `save` function. You can either:
   - return the same HTML as the `edit` function, which will be saved as-is in the post content, or
   - use a very minimal `save` function to let the Comet PHP take care of all front-end rendering.

I have opted for option 2 because it's less code duplication and less prone to hard-to-debug inconsistencies, and prevents "rogue" classes from being added to the output.

For example, this...
```javascript
save: ({ attributes }) => {
	return createElement(
		'section',
		useBlockProps.save({
			className: 'banner'
		}),
		createElement(
			'div',
			{ className: 'banner__overlay'},
		),
		createElement(
			'div',
			{ className: 'banner__content' },
			createElement(InnerBlocks.Content)
		)
	);
}
```
...somehow brings with it WordPress's built-in utility classes, such as `banner__content` having `is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-comet-banner-is-layout-1 wp-block-comet-banner-is-layout-constrained` added to it, which I don't want.

Instead, I use a minimal `save` function like this:
```javascript
	save: () => {
	return createElement(
		'section',
		useBlockProps.save(),
		createElement(InnerBlocks.Content)
	);
}
```
...which saves a minimal version of the block and allows me more control over the output from my PHP code.

There are valid reasons to choose option 1 - having the code in the database closely match the PHP-driven output could be a useful fallback; it's just not the approach I have chosen because I am prioritising predictability, clean markup, minimal code duplication.
