# Storybook customisation notes

- Files in the `blocks` directory are largely copied from the `@storybook/blocks` source code for the purposes of
  customising some of them. Some have not changed other than fixing imports; they're just copied for the purposes of
  getting to the component(s) I actually needed to modify. See `preview.tsx` for the root of the docs page layout.
- Files in the `components` folder are my custom components, used both for customising the docs pages and for my custom
  addons.
